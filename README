Apache::PageKit
===============

Status
------
Version: 0.91 (Alpha)
API is subject to change, and should stablize as
we approach version 1.00 (First Beta Release)

Description
-----------
	PageKit is a web applications framework that is based on mod_perl.
	This framework is distinguished from others such as Embperl and Mason
	by providing a clear seperation of programming, content and
	presentation.

	It does this by implementing a Model/View/Content/Controller paradigm:
		- Model is user supplied Perl classes
		- View is set of HTML::Templates
		- Content is set of XML Files
		- Controller is PageKit

	This allows your programmers, designers and content editors to work
	independently with clean well-defined interfaces.

	PageKit provides the following features:
		- Component-based architecture
		- Language Localization
		- Session Management
		- Input Validation
		- Sticky HTML Forms
		- Authentication
		- Co-branding
		- Automatic Dispatching of URIs
		- Easy Error Handling

	- mod_perl
	- libapreq
	- Apache::Session 1.5

Installation
------------
	After installing the requirements, you can use the standard

	perl Makefile.PL

	You will be prompted for the location of your mod_perl server.
	This will be used to start a running PageKit enabled web server
	for testing.

	to your httpd.conf
