PageKit is a set of Perl modules that provides an application framework and uses mod_perl and
HTML::Template. It employs a Model/View/Content/Controller approach to design, with complete
separation of Perl from HTML. PageKit includes session management, authentication, form validation,
sticky HTML forms, multiple views/co-branding, modules and a simple content management system.
