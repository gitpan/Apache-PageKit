Revision history for Perl extension Apache::PageKit.

0.91
	- Changed name of page_id_match configuration directive to
		uri_match.
	- Fixed some permission problems when 'make test' is run
		as root.

0.90  Sun Dec 24 01:26:18 2000 EST
	- Major changes in API and streamlining of pagekit
		in preparation for 1.0 beta release.  
	- Removed seldom used options and replaced others with
		more user-friendly versions.
	- Renamed Controller directory to Config directory
	- Renamed <TMPL_VAR> and <TMPL_LOOP> tags to
		<MODEL_VAR> and <MODEL_LOOP> for Model Data and
		<CONTENT_VAR> and <CONTENT_LOOP> for Content Data and
		<PKIT_VAR> and <PKIT_LOOP> for PageKit Data
	- Renamed <PKIT_INCLUDE> to <PKIT_COMPONENT> and replaced
		'include' with 'component' across the framework
	- Moved and renamed nav_title option from config to 
		<NAV_TITLE> </NAV_TITLE> in content XML for
		better foreign language support.
	- Renamed Apache::PageKit::FormValidator to Apache::PageKit::Model
		and redesigned class to replace form_validator
		constructor option with $model->validate_input($hash_ref)
		method.  Eliminated error_page and error_page_run_code
		options (user should use $pk->continue
		in model instead).  This should make the development
		easier because all the logic is in the Model class instead
		being scattered across the derived class and configuration.
	- View templates get pre-parsed using file_cache/cache option of
		HTML::Template, and the HTML can be optimized by
		using HTML::Clean if html_clean_level is set to >=1
	- Changed template_cache option to use yes for cache
		in HTML::Template and no for file_cache.
		Got rid of shared_cache, since it is problematic
		and file_cache is almost as fast.
	- Moved fill_in_form to page attr from global attr
	- Removed support for domains, including page_domain,
		domain, is_topdomain attributes.
	- Removed page based linking attributes, including
		support for <PKIT_LINK> and <PKIT_JAVASCRIPT> tags and
		is_popup, is_secure, popup_width, and popup_height.

	- Created Apache::PageKit::Content, for XML content
	- Created content XML files for separation of
		content from presentation
	- Reorganized pagekit.org files into Model/View/Content/Controller
		directories
	- Rewrote pagekit.org site to use DBD::Sprite and Apache::Session::File
		instead of MySQL, so could include in test suite without
		requiring MySQL
	- Used Apache::Test in test suite to test working copy of pagekit.org
		web site.
